# OASF-to-Grounded-Agency Capability Mapping
# Machine-readable translation between the Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF)
# and the Grounded Agency Capability Ontology.
#
# OASF Reference: https://schema.oasf.outshift.com
# OASF Version:   0.8.0
# Grounded Agency: 36 atomic capabilities across 9 cognitive layers
#
# Mapping types:
#   direct       — 1:1 capability correspondence
#   domain       — Same capability with domain parameter specialization
#   composition  — Multiple capabilities required
#   workflow     — Maps to a composed workflow pattern
#   ga_extension — GA-native capability with no OASF equivalent (synthetic GA-xxx code)

    notes: >
      Stored data retrieval from agent memory. OASF is task-oriented
      and does not model internal agent memory as a skill category.
      Maps to the REMEMBER layer's recall capability.

  GA-004:
    name: Event Reception
    capabilities: [receive]
    mapping_type: ga_extension
    layer: PERCEIVE
    domain_hint: event
    notes: >
      Pushed data and event acceptance. OASF is task-oriented, not
      event-driven; there is no skill for passive data reception.
      Maps to the PERCEIVE layer's receive capability.

  GA-005:
    name: Data Transmission
    capabilities: [send]
    mapping_type: ga_extension
    layer: EXECUTE
    domain_hint: network
    notes: >
      External data transmission. OASF treats output as implicit,
      not a distinct skill. Maps to the EXECUTE layer's send
      capability. High risk — requires checkpoint enforcement.

  GA-006:
    name: State Transition Modeling
    capabilities: [transition]
    mapping_type: ga_extension
    layer: MODEL
    domain_hint: dynamics
    notes: >
      State machine transition and dynamics modeling. No OASF category
      covers state machine transitions explicitly. Maps to the MODEL
      layer's transition capability for modeling system dynamics.
