# Vision Domain Profile
# Calibrated for computer vision, image analysis, and visual AI applications.
# Maps to OASF Category 2 (Computer Vision): image segmentation, object detection,
# image generation, depth estimation, and visual transformations.
#
# NOTE: The profile domain name 'vision' refers to the agent specialization.
# Capability domain parameters use 'image.*' (e.g., domain: image.object).
# See docs/guides/MODALITY_HANDLING.md for the domain parameter convention.

  Profile for computer vision and image processing environments.
  Emphasizes visual evidence grounding, spatial reasoning accuracy,
  and appropriate confidence thresholds for visual classification tasks.
