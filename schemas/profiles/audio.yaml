# Audio Domain Profile
# Calibrated for audio processing, speech analysis, and acoustic AI applications.
# Maps to OASF Category 3 (Audio): audio classification, speech recognition,
# speaker identification, sound event detection, and audio synthesis.
#
# NOTE: The profile domain name 'audio' matches the capability domain parameter
# convention (e.g., domain: audio.speech, domain: audio.event).
# See docs/guides/MODALITY_HANDLING.md for the domain parameter convention.

version: "1.0.0"
description: |
  Profile for audio processing and acoustic analysis environments.
  Emphasizes temporal evidence grounding, signal quality assessment,
  and appropriate confidence thresholds for audio classification and
  speech recognition tasks.

risk_thresholds:
  auto_approve: low           # Only low-risk audio analysis auto-approved

  require_human: high         # High-risk audio decisions require human
  block_autonomous:
    - mutate                  # Never autonomously modify source audio
    - send                    # Never autonomously distribute audio content

checkpoint_policy:
  before_audio_modification: always     # Always checkpoint before modifying audio
  before_transcription_output: always   # Always checkpoint before final transcription

    - detect                   # Sound event detections must reference time segments
    - classify                 # Audio classifications must cite acoustic features
    - predict                  # Audio predictions must reference temporal patterns
    - generate                 # Generated audio must cite source/prompt
    - transform                # Audio transformations must document signal processing steps
