## Intent

Define the rules governing how a system's state changes over time. This capability captures state machine semantics: what triggers transitions, what preconditions must hold, and what effects occur.

**Success criteria:**
- Transition rules clearly specified
- Preconditions and effects documented
- Triggers identified with evidence
- State machine is deterministic (or non-determinism noted)

**Compatible schemas:**
- `schemas/transition_schema.yaml`

## Inputs

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `from_state` | Yes | object | Initial state or state pattern |
| `to_state` | No | object | Target state (optional for discovery mode) |
| `triggers` | No | array | Events or conditions that cause transition |
| `scope` | No | string | Domain to analyze for transitions |

## Procedure

1) **Identify state variables**: Determine what can change
   - Extract mutable properties from state model
   - Identify discrete vs continuous variables
   - Note invariants (what cannot change)

2) **Discover triggers**: Find what causes state changes
   - Identify events (user actions, system events)
   - Find conditions (thresholds, timeouts)
   - Note external inputs that affect state

3) **Define preconditions**: Specify when transitions can occur
   - Document required state for transition
   - Identify guards and conditions
   - Note blocking conditions

4) **Specify effects**: Document what changes during transition
   - List state variable changes
   - Note side effects (events emitted, actions taken)
   - Capture ordering constraints

5) **Validate completeness**: Check for missing transitions
   - Identify unreachable states
   - Find states with no outgoing transitions
   - Note non-deterministic cases

6) **Ground rules**: Document evidence for each transition rule
   - Reference code, configuration, or documentation
   - Note confidence in each rule

## Output Contract

```yaml

  - id: string  # Unique rule identifier
    name: string  # Human-readable name

## Verification

- [ ] Each rule has from and to state patterns
- [ ] Triggers are specified for each rule
- [ ] Preconditions are testable
- [ ] Effects are specific and verifiable
- [ ] Reachability analysis covers all known states

**Verification tools:** Read (to verify code references)

## Safety Constraints

- `mutation`: false
- `requires_checkpoint`: false
- `requires_approval`: false
- `risk`: low

**Capability-specific rules:**
- Document non-determinism explicitly
- Flag missing transitions for terminal states
- Note when transitions have side effects
- Do not execute transitions while modeling

## Composition Patterns

**Commonly follows:**
- `state` - State model provides basis for transitions
- `observe` - Observations reveal transition patterns
- `discover` - Discovery finds unknown transitions

**Commonly precedes:**
- `simulate` - Transitions drive simulation
- `plan` - Transitions inform action planning
- `verify` - Transitions specify expected behavior

**Anti-patterns:**
- Never use transition to execute changes (use `mutate`)
- Avoid modeling transitions without state model first

**Workflow references:**
- See `workflow_catalog.yaml#world_model_build` for transitions in world modeling
- See `workflow_catalog.yaml#digital_twin_sync_loop` for transition application
