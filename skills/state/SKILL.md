## Intent

Create a structured representation of the current state of a domain, system, or entity. This is the foundation for world modeling, enabling tracking of entities, relationships, and properties over time.

**Success criteria:**
- State captured in structured, queryable format
- Entities and relationships clearly identified
- Uncertainty and confidence explicitly represented
- Evidence anchors for all state assertions

**Compatible schemas:**
- `schemas/world_state_schema.yaml`

## Inputs

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `scope` | Yes | string | What domain/system to model (e.g., "user authentication", "payment processing") |
| `schema` | No | object | State schema defining expected structure |
| `timestamp` | No | string | Point in time for state (default: now) |
| `depth` | No | string | Modeling depth: surface, detailed, comprehensive |

## Procedure

1) **Define scope boundaries**: Clarify what is included in the state model
   - Identify system or domain boundaries
   - Determine entity types to include
   - Establish relationship types to capture

2) **Identify entities**: Enumerate entities within scope
   - Extract entity references from sources
   - Assign unique identifiers
   - Capture entity properties/attributes

3) **Map relationships**: Document connections between entities
   - Identify relationship types (contains, depends_on, references)
   - Note relationship directionality
   - Capture relationship properties

4) **Capture current values**: Record current state of each entity
   - Document property values with evidence
   - Note uncertainty where values are unclear
   - Record observation timestamp

5) **Apply schema**: Structure state according to schema if provided
   - Validate against schema constraints
   - Note schema violations or extensions needed
   - Ensure required fields are populated

6) **Ground state claims**: Attach evidence to all assertions
   - Reference source files, commands, or observations
   - Note confidence level for each assertion

## Output Contract

Return a structured object:

```yaml
state:
  world_id: string  # Unique identifier for this state snapshot
  scope: string  # Domain being modeled
  timestamp: string  # When state was captured
  entities:

  relationships:
    - from: string  # Source entity ID
      to: string  # Target entity ID

      properties: object  # Relationship attributes
  meta:
    version: string  # State schema version

## Verification

- [ ] State includes world_id and timestamp
- [ ] All entities have unique IDs and types
- [ ] Relationships reference valid entity IDs
- [ ] Confidence scores present for entities
- [ ] Evidence anchors support state assertions

**Verification tools:** Read (to verify file references)

## Safety Constraints

- `mutation`: false
- `requires_checkpoint`: false
- `requires_approval`: false
- `risk`: low

**Capability-specific rules:**
- Do not modify state while modeling it
- Note when state may be stale or dynamic
- Flag entities with low confidence
- Do not invent entities without evidence

## Composition Patterns

**Commonly follows:**
- `observe` - Observations feed into state modeling
- `retrieve` - Retrieved data informs state
- `integrate` - Merged data forms state

**Commonly precedes:**
- `transition` - State enables transition modeling
- `compare` - States can be compared (diff)
- `simulate` - State is starting point for simulation

**Anti-patterns:**
- Never use state for predictions (use `predict`)
- Avoid state for single-value measurement (use `measure`)

**Workflow references:**
- See `workflow_catalog.yaml#world_model_build` for state in world modeling
- See `workflow_catalog.yaml#digital_twin_sync_loop` for state in digital twins
