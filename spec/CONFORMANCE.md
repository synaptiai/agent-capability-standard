# Conformance

Normative requirements are in [STANDARD-v1.1.0 §10](STANDARD-v1.1.0.md#10-conformance);
this page summarises them.

## Conformance levels
- **L1 Structural Conformance**
  - validates required fields and field types
  - validates capability existence
  - enforces `requires`, `precedes` and `conflicts_with`; warns on unmet
    `soft_requires`
  - resolves effective safety flags; warns on downgrades
  - reports unknown fields and the declared standard version
  - validates binding path existence

- **L2 Type Conformance**
  - resolves `$ref` schemas
  - infers binding types
  - requires typed annotations only when ambiguous
  - validates typed annotations

- **L3 Contract Conformance**
  - validates binding types against consumer input_schema
  - parses and type-checks condition expressions
  - emits coercion hints

- **L4 Patch Conformance**
  - emits patch suggestions JSON
  - emits optional diff patch (`--emit-patch`)
  - uses coercion registry when available

Every diagnostic has a fixed severity: errors make a workflow invalid,
warnings (W6xx) do not, unless the validator runs in strict mode
(`--strict`).

**Reference implementation:** L4 (`tools/validate_workflows.py`, backed by
the Rust core in `core/`).

## Required artifacts
- Capability ontology file
- Workflow catalog file
- Schema bundle + policies
- Validator CLI

## Test suite requirements
- Positive fixtures: valid workflows (`tests/fixtures/pass_*`)
- Negative fixtures: invalid references, type mismatches, ambiguous nodes,
  edge and version violations, and malformed or undeclared extensions
  (`tests/fixtures/fail_*`)
- Patch fixtures: expected patch suggestions and diff output
- Expectations in `tests/fixtures/EXPECTATIONS.json`: `should_pass`,
  `expected_error_codes`, and `expected_warning_codes` (an empty list means
  no warnings may be emitted)
- Expression fixtures, language-neutral:
  `tests/conformance/expressions/eval.json` (evaluation results and runtime
  errors) and `tests/conformance/expressions/check.json` (static
  diagnostics). `tools/cel_differential` runs them against cel-go to check
  CEL compatibility.

Run the suite with `python scripts/run_conformance.py`.
