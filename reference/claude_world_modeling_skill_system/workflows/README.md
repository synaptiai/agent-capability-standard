# Workflow catalog

These workflows are **compositions of capability atoms**.

They can be:
- executed manually (invoke skills in sequence)
- turned into composed skills (see `/skills_composed`)
- used as a reference when building automation hooks

Files:
- `workflow_catalog.yaml`
- `workflow_catalog.json`
