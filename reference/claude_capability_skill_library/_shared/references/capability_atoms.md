# Capability atoms

This library merges:
- DIS feature atoms (Detect/Identify/Estimate/Forecast/Compare/Discover/Generate/Act)
- Agentic + world-modeling atoms (retrieve/search/inspect, schema/graphs, planning, verification, governance, world modeling)

You can treat each capability as an “atomic unit” and compose them into higher-level workflows.
