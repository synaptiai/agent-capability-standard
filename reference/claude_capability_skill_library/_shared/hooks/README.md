# Hooks (templates)

Hooks are configured in Claude Code settings, not inside a skill folder.
These are **starter templates** you can adapt.

Suggested hooks:
- block secret paths (PreToolUse)
- require checkpoint before Edit/Bash in high-risk contexts
- run formatter/linter after edits (PostToolUse)
- log tool usage (PostToolUse)
