# Press kit

## One-liner
A publishable open standard for **composable agent capabilities** with a **type-safe workflow DSL** and a **world modeling schema**.

## What problem it solves
Most agent systems fail in production because:
- composition is implicit (no contracts)
- state is ungrounded (no provenance)
- conflict resolution is undefined (no trust model)
- safety is retrofitted (no checkpoints/rollback)

This standard fixes that by making reliability *structural*.

## Key innovations
- Atomic capability ontology with explicit dependencies and I/O schemas
- Workflow DSL with gates, recovery loops, parallelism, typed bindings
- Canonical world-state model with uncertainty, provenance, lineage, retention
- Authority trust model with time decay + field-specific authority
- Compiler-grade validator that can propose deterministic transform patches

## Short announcement template
We’re releasing an open standard for building agent systems that don’t break in production:
atomic capabilities + type-safe workflow composition + grounded world models + trust-aware conflict resolution.
Reference implementation included.
