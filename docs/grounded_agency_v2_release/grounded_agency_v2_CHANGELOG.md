# Grounded Agency v2 (Improved paper)

This revision improves the paper drafted from the v10 standard repository.

## Major upgrades
- Removes/softens unverifiable evaluation claims; focuses on reproducible, spec-grounded contributions.
- Fixes DIS '23 citation: uses DOI 10.1145/3563657.3596058.
- Clarifies the standard’s normative artifacts: ontology, workflow DSL, schemas, policies, validator.
- Adds a clean formal model: Capability / Workflow / Skill / World State.
- Documents validator responsibilities precisely (ref resolution, preconditions, type inference, coercion hints).
- Tightens related work to relevant baselines (ReAct, Reflexion, Soar, ACT-R, Claude Code features).

## What to do next (if publishing)
- Replace placeholder URLs in references with final links in your repository README.
- Add an appendix that lists all 99 capabilities + layers (can be auto-generated from the ontology file).
